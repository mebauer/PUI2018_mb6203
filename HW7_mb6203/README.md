## Assignment 1: census geospatial analysis.

### Team Members: I worked with Manrique Vargas, and for the advance topics, I requested help from Tanya Nabila (her assistance can be found during the second half of the assignment).

### From Professor Bianco: *This assignment is designed to familiarize you with the US Census data (really the 1-year survey data) and at the same time to make you exercise with spatial analysis in geopandas. The goal is to assess if the linkNYC stations are located to provide a useful service and to fill in a need. You will work with the American Fact Finder data via API and direct download, and with NYC shapefiles. this homework is long. if you leave it to the last minute it will be hard to finish it**

In my opinion, learning geopandas was quite interesting and can be applied to many of my workflows.
