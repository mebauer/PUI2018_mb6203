Hi **tp1600**, thank you for the insightful plot highlighting **Trends in Individuals in Homeless Shelters 2014-2018**. Here are my comments and suggestions about your plot.  

### CLARITY: ###  

First of all, great topic! Definitely an interesting and relevant plot. I would have liked to see a caption at the bottom conveying what the plot displays and what you concluded from the trends. The two bottom lines don't seem to be increasing. Is there a reason? Also, it's hard to tell the percent of change within these items, as the viewer has to eye-ball if the trend is declining or inclining. 

### AESTHETIC: ###

The plot is easy to read, however, is there a difference between the background colors (orange and blue)? Additionally, perhaps the line-weights might need to be enhanced so it's easier to read. There are also six items in the legend, but only four items are displayed in the plot. Maybe changing the colors a bit would assist the viewer.

### HONESTY: ###

Again, great topic, and I'm certainly interested to see more analysis! However, the big item for me is the missing caption. It's hard to tell exactly what's going on, and what the reasons for these trends might be.  

Thank you for sharing! I'm happy to discuss more if you'd like.

Best,

Mark Bauer
