# Disclaimer about group work: # 

For assignment one, I worked strictly alone. 

For assignment two, I worked with numerous students mainly on Saturday afternoon and Wednesday evening. Group members include:
- **Manrique Vargas**
- **Kate Cauley**

Manrique and Kate really assisted with assignment 2, and Alia helped me with assignment 3.
