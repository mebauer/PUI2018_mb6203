# PUI2018 HW 4: Assignments 1, 2, and 3

## Assignment 1: Write an ipython notebook that demonstrates visually in a data-driven way the Central Limit Theorem.
### Team members: Yushi (Amber) Chan, Mengyun Li, Sarah Aita, and Mark Bauer.
Assignment 1 was a collaboration between Amber, Mengyun, Sarah, and myself. Every team member participated in some aspect of the project and the code. 

- Generated 100 samples of different sizes from various distributions: Normal Poisson, Binomial, Chi-Squared, and Logistic.
- Plotted the sample mean for each distribution (sample mean, dependent variable, against the sample size N, independent variable.
- Described the behavior of the Central Limit Theorum.
- Finally, plotted all the sample means together for all the distributions.

## Assignment 2: Set up the work for data-driven inference based on CitiBike data.
### Team members: Yushi (Amber) Chan, Manrique Vargas, and Mark Bauer.
Assignment 2 was a collaboration between Yushi (Amber) Chan, Manrique Vargas, and myself. Every team member participated in some aspect of the project and the code.
