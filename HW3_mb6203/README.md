# PUI2018 HW 3 # 

## PLEASE READ ##

This homework was exceptionally difficult for me, and I received immense help from various students at CUSP (names mentioned below). All of the assistance was given in person at CUSP with thorough explanation and reasoning. With that being said, all code for homework 3 was typed physically by me.

I worked extensively with Yushi Chen, a student at NYU CUSP. She assisted to help set up the code in Jupyter Notebook, and guided me through syntax errors throughout the life of the project.

My scatter plots were exported as a .pdf, and the caption notes can be found in the code (I wasn't sure how to export the caption text as well). I attempted to include all chart elements. More information can be found in the jupyter notebook.

# Part 3: Write scripts to stream real-time bus data from MTA through the MTA Bus Time interface. In order to access this data, you must first request an API key from MTA. # 

## Assignment 3: Tracking each vehicle for a line ##

Please find the python script titled show_bus_locations_mb6203.py

## Assignment 4: Next stop information ##

Please find the python script titled get_bus_info_mb6203.py

These last two assignments were particularly challenging for me. Thus, I had extensive help getting started through the code, creating the python script, and also received assistance debugging at the end. I received the most assistance creating the python script, forming arguments, and the correct syntax of the code (I still don't quite understand this section, but I will be revisiting it as frequently as I can).

Students assistance:
- Yushi Chen
- Tanya Nabila
- Marvin Mananghaya
- Urwa Muaz
- Manrique Vargas

All of the student guidance/feedback was in-person at CUSP's building, and extensive explanation/reasoning was provided to me by all of these students while working through code. Each student provided feedback and contributing to my learning.
