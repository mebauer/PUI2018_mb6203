These last two assignments were particularly challenging for me. Thus, I had extensive help getting started through the code, creating the python script, and also received assistance debugging at the end. I received the most assistance creating the python script, forming arguments, and the correct syntax of the code.

Students involved in assisting me:
- Yushi Chen
- Tanya Nabila
- Marvin Mananghaya
- Urwa Muaz
- Manrique Vargas

I can't stress this enough that these last two assignments were particulularly challenging for me. All of the student guidance/feedback was in-person at CUSP's building, and extensive explanation was provided to me by all of these students while working through code.
