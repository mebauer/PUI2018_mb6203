##### Figure 1: New school projects (Capacity) and Capital Improvement Projects (CIP) currently under Construction.

### Comments: The visualization is very clear in general. The color choice is clean, the legend for the color scale is clear. I would suggest to explain the areas filled with white color since there are several zipcode zones are white but there is no legend explaining what does it mean. The caption is brief and clear. I would suggest writing more about the discoveries from the visualization. For example point out the clusters on the map with more New school projects and Capital Improvement Projects; or answer how strong is the spacial correlation in this analysis.
