# We created a directory called PUI2018

## We created an environment variable called PUI2018 that pointed to our directory called PUI2018.

### To save our environmental variable permanently, we saved the corde in ~/.bashrc. This way, our $PUI2018 environmental variable is set to (the ~ in ~/.bashrc means our home directory. 

### We then created an alias as a shortcut command that takes us to that directory.

### And finally, we took screenshots of our .bashrc file where we can see the alias and env. variable we created.
