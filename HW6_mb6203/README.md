# This is my README file for HW6

## For Professor Bianco

Dear Professor Bianco,

I am utilizing my 72-hour extension for homework 6. I work full-time, and I had two exams for another graduate program I am pursuing in Coastal Sciences and Hydrodynamics.

Also, pleased be advised that I did not recieve any pull request for assignment 1. Maybe I wasn't assigned a reviewer? 

**Technical Details about HW6:**

Homework 3 and 4 I utilized your *solutions* notebooks. Although the output looks fairly similar, I attempted to change items where I could (i.e. assigning variables new names, new comments in my own words, etc.). 

## Assignment 1: Review your classmate's Citibike project proposal

Assignment 1 is titled CitibikeReview_mb6203.md



Submit a pull request to the original repository to share your markdown.



## Assignment 2: Literature choices of statistical tests
The last two tests were performed with assistance from **Alia Kasem**

Work with one, or maximum two people (**I worked with Alia**).

Choose three tests from the table in the slides

stats test

one in the top potrion of the chart (chi-sq, t-test, and the ANOVA family of tests) where you are looking for differences between groups, and one in the bottom portion where you are looking for relationships bewteen the dependent and independent variables (correlation, regression, path analysis), and a logistic regression.

Test 1: Plot of stable isotope values A. δ15N versus δ13C and B. δ34S versus δ13C for Myotis myotis, M. mystacinus and M. daubentonii. Values indicate that each species occupied a different isotopic niche. The population of M. myotis (Ermatingen) (open circles), which roosted closer to water, occupied the same niche as the population farther away (full circles).
